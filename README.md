# 🧠 Recruitment Satire Post

Welcome to the **Recruitment Satire Post**, a brutally honest HTML mock-up of a LinkedIn post from a fictional recruiter named *Rachel Headhunter*—Senior Talent Acquisition Wizard 🧙‍♀️ and Professional Dream Crusher.

This project is a satirical take on modern hiring practices, including:
- Ghosting candidates after multi-round interviews
- Fake job listings designed to harvest data
- Unpaid assessments disguised as "opportunities"
- The performative optimism of LinkedIn culture

## 🔍 What’s Inside

- `index.html`: A fully styled HTML post mimicking a LinkedIn recruiter update, complete with emojis, hashtags, and ironic engagement metrics.
- CSS animations and layout that mirror the tone of corporate absurdity.
- A warning badge labeled **SATIRE**—because someone will definitely miss the joke.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is designed to:
- Highlight the emotional toll of modern recruitment
- Spark conversation around ethical hiring practices
- Make people laugh, wince, and maybe rethink their pipeline strategy
