    <title>Corporate Dynamics™ Resilience Assessment</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Corporate Blue, Neutral Grays, Subtle Green/Red feedback -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A multi-screen single-page application structured as an interactive quiz. The user flows from a start screen, through each question sequentially, to a final results screen. This structure was chosen because it directly translates the static assessment into an engaging, gamified experience, enhancing the satirical tone by mimicking a real corporate e-learning module. Presenting one question at a time focuses user attention and builds narrative momentum. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Assessment Questions -> Goal: Engage & Test User -> Presentation: Interactive multi-choice question cards -> Interaction: User clicks an answer, receives instant feedback, and automatically proceeds -> Justification: Creates a dynamic and intuitive user experience that is more compelling than a static text document. Report Info: Scoring Guide -> Goal: Conclude & Reward User -> Presentation: Final results screen with score and descriptive text -> Interaction: "Try Again" button to restart the quiz -> Justification: Provides a clear, satisfying end to the quiz with a humorous payoff and replayability. All elements use HTML/CSS/JS, no SVG/Mermaid. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
